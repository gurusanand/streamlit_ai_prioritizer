## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Python is not recognized"

**Problem:** Command Prompt says "python is not recognized"

**Solution:**
1. Python wasn't added to PATH during installation
2. Uninstall Python
3. Reinstall and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

### Issue 2: "pip is not recognized"

**Problem:** Command Prompt says "pip is not recognized"

**Solution:**
1. Try using `python -m pip` instead of `pip`
2. Example: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue 3: Permission Errors

**Problem:** "Access denied" or "Permission error"

**Solution:**
1. Right-click Command Prompt
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Navigate to project folder and try again

### Issue 4: Port Already in Use

**Problem:** "Port 8501 is already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Close any other Streamlit applications
2. Or use a different port:
   ```cmd
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
   ```

### Issue 5: OpenAI API Errors

**Problem:** "Invalid API key" or "Insufficient credits"

**Solution:**
1. Check your API key in `.env` file is correct
2. Verify you have credits at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
3. The app will still work without OpenAI - just with basic insights

### Issue 6: Can't See .env File

**Problem:** Can't find or create .env file

**Solution:**
1. In File Explorer, click "View" tab
2. Check "File name extensions"
3. Check "Hidden items"
4. Now you can see and create .env files

### Issue 7: Browser Doesn't Open

**Problem:** App starts but browser doesn't open

**Solution:**
1. Look at the Command Prompt for the URL
2. Usually: http://localhost:8501
3. Copy and paste this URL into your browser manually

## üìä Data Storage

- All your data is stored in `data/assessments.db`
- This is a SQLite database file
- To backup your data, copy this file
- To reset everything, delete this file (it will be recreated)

## üîí Security Tips

1. **Keep your .env file private**
   - Never share it
   - Don't upload it to cloud storage
   - Don't commit it to Git

2. **Protect your OpenAI API key**
   - Keep it secret
   - Monitor usage at https://platform.openai.com/account/usage
   - Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

3. **Backup your data**
   - Regularly copy `data/assessments.db`
   - Store backups in a safe location

## üéì Next Steps

Once you have the app running:

1. Read the main README.md for feature details
2. Explore the About page in the app
3. Create a test use case to familiarize yourself
4. Review the 31 dimensions in the framework

## üìû Getting Help

If you're still having trouble:

1. Check the main README.md troubleshooting section
2. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
3. Verify all packages installed correctly: `pip list`
